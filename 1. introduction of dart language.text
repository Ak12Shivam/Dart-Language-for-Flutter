########## INTRODUCTION OF DART LANGUAGE ##########

///////////  WHAT IS THE DART LANGUAGE! //////////
=>Dart is an open-source programming language developed by Google.
  It is designed to be a versatile and efficient language for building a wide range of applications,
  including web, mobile, desktop, and server applications.
->  Dart was initially released in 2011 and has since gained popularity for its focus on performance,
    productivity, and maintainability.

////////// THE KEY FEATURES:- //////////

1. OBJECT-ORIENTED: Dart is an object-oriented language, which means that everything in Dart is an object. It supports concepts such as classes, inheritance, interfaces, and mixins, making it easy to organize and structure your code.

2. STRONGLY TYPED: Dart is optionally typed, meaning you can choose to specify data types for your variables or rely on type inference to determine types automatically. This flexibility strikes a balance between the benefits of static typing and the convenience of dynamic typing.

3. GARBAGE COLLUCTION: Dart uses automatic memory management with garbage collection, which helps developers focus more on their code's logic and less on memory management tasks.

4. ASYNC/AWAIT: Dart has built-in support for asynchronous programming through the async and await keywords. This makes it easier to write efficient and responsive applications, especially when dealing with tasks such as network requests or file I/O.

5. SINGLE-THREADED MODEL WITH ISOLATES: Dart follows a single-threaded model for executing code but offers a concurrency mechanism called "isolates." Isolates are lightweight, independent execution contexts that enable developers to take advantage of multi-core processors without the complexities of traditional multi-threading.

6. FLUTTER FRAMEWORK: One of Dart's most notable use cases is as the primary language for building applications using the Flutter framework. Flutter is a UI toolkit that allows developers to create natively compiled applications for mobile, web, and desktop from a single codebase. This has contributed significantly to Dart's popularity.

7. AOT and JIT COMPILATION: Dart supports both Ahead-of-Time (AOT) and Just-in-Time (JIT) compilation. AOT compilation is used for producing efficient, standalone executables, while JIT compilation aids in rapid development and hot-reload capabilities, especially useful in the context of Flutter app development.

8. PACKAGE MANAGEMENT: Dart provides a package management system called Pub. It allows developers to easily share, distribute, and use third-party libraries in their projects, enhancing code reusability and efficiency.

9. OPEN SOURCE and COMMUNITY-DRIVEN: Dart is open source and benefits from an active community of developers contributing to its growth. This has led to the development of various libraries, frameworks, and tools that extend Dart's capabilities.
